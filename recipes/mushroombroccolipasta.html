    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe I always ate growing up. It's always felt very homey and is great for a cold winter day or if you aren't feel great. It's super easy and quick to make, with very few ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2-4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>200-300g of tortellinis or pasta of your choice</li>
        <li>1 whole broccoli</li>
        <li>400-500g of button mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 box of boursin</li>
        <li>150ml of creme fraiche (or more to taste, you can also replace this with haver fraiche)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil and crush garlic in a large frying pan at medium heat until slightly yellow and aromatic.</li>
        <li>Chop onions and add to garlic and stir them until they turn slightly yellow and start to smell sweet.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a water cooker or boil water in a pot until it bubbles/boils.</li>
        <li>Chop mushrooms and add to frying pan once the onions are starting to cook. </li>
        <li>Add tortellinis to boiling water and boil for 15 minutes. If you have a different pasta, you might need to time it differently and start this step later if it has a shorter cooking time. </li>
        <li>Chop or break the broccoli into small pieces and add to frying pan.</li>
        <li>Stir fry the broccoli, mushrooms, onions and garlic until everything is well done.</li>
        <li>Turn the fire down to low heat, add the creme fraiche and boursin and mix well so all the vegetables are covered.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done cooking, pour water out and add the pasta to the vegetables and sauce in the frying pan. Mix well until all the pasta is mixed.</li>
        <li>You are now ready to serve a delicious and warm pasta! You can also choose to serve this with some vegetarian chicken, bacon or add some smoked salmon.</li>
    </ol>
