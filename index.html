    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my first webpage built as part of my attempt to learn to code by completing <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. I thought I might as well throw in some recipes I actually like. So here are some of my favourite homey meals. 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="recipes/gingermisosalad.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginger garlic miso tahini salad</a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                This is a delicious healthy and refreshing vegan salad that has a perfect combination of sweet and savoury, it's mostly vegetables so perfect if you don't want something too heavy on a hot summer day.
                </li> 
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="recipes/mushroombroccolipasta.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creamy mushroom and broccoli pasta</a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                This is a recipe my mom used to make for me almost every week, it's a homey warm and filling meal, great for cold winter days. I absolutely love it with tortellinis, but you can make it with any pasta you like.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="recipes/homemademuesli.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homemade muesli</a>
            <ul>
                <li>
                This is a recipe I make year round for a nut-packed crunchy muesli every morning. I use it to top off fresh fruit and (soy) yogurt and acaii/smoothie bowls in the summer or porridge and overnight oats in the winter. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
